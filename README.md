Learn Python Through Testing
============================

Welcome!

The purpose of this project is to provide you with an introduction
to the tools and conventions of Python development. It is assumed that you
are familiar with scripting in Python. Instead, these exercises will focus
on using GitHub, test-driven development, and the conventions that Python
coders use every day.

**How to proceed:**

0. Getting Started.

     * Create your own GitHub account.
     * Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
     * Download the repo to your computer in one of these ways:

            - or click on the 'Clone or Download' button
     * Explore the files in this project.
     * Open module_0.py and run it.

1. A Simple Coding Exercise: module_1.py

    In this module, you'll familiarize yourself with the concept of unit
    testing and how these modules will work.

2. Odd-Even Excercise: module_2.py

    Create a function that returns only odd numbers.

3. Population Pyramid: module_3.py

    Create a series of functions that produce a population pyramid.
