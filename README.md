============================
Learn Python Through Testing
============================

Welcome!

The purpose of this project is to provide you with an introduction
to the tools and conventions of Python development. It is assumed that you
are familiar with scripting in Python. Instead, these exercises will focus
on using GitHub, test-driven development, and the conventions that Python
coders use every day.

**How to proceed:**

1. Getting Started.

    _Make sure that you've completed this part already!_

    * Switch branches to Master to see the instructions for this exercise.

2. A Simple Coding Exercise: module_1.py

    _In this module, you'll familiarize yourself with the concept of unit
    testing and github._

    * Open the file module_1.py
    * Read the instructions in the docstring for the module.
    * First, you'll run the file to see how the tests work...
    * ...and fix a broken function
    * Then, you'll write your own test.
    * Make sure that all of the tests pass!

    * Commit your changes as you make them. (Github Desktop makes this easy)
    * Sync your local changes with your remote repo on Github (Sync button)
    * Create a 'Pull Request' back to my learn_python repo. (You don't need
       to wait until you are finished to do this. All of your commits will
       show up in the pull request as soon as you commit, and we can chat
       about your progress as you go.)

3. Odd-Even Excercise: module_2.py

    _Create a function that returns only odd numbers._

    * Switch branches to module_2 to get the instructions for this exercise.
